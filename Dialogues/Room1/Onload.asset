  sentences:
  - Finally, I got my first case. Soon, my dream to become famous detective will
    come true. But how much should I charge Milly?
  - "Oh, March! Thank God you\u2019ve arrived. I\u2019m so relieved. (Depressed)"
  - What happened? You look depressed.
  - "Many things have changed since my grandfather passed away\u2026 "
  - "Mr. Peter Robinson, right? I\u2019m so sorry. When did this happen?"
  - 'Last year, he died of a heart attack. '
  - ' A heart attack? '
  - Yes. This was a year ago. We all went to the nearby park while Grandpa stayed
    at home. He said he had some work to do on the computer.
  - " But when we came back, we found him dead, right on his computer table. \t                 
    A few months after his death, strange things started to happen. "
  - "Ahh\u2026 strange things? (Little worried as she is scared of ghosts)"
  - Creepy noises in the night, moving furniture, objects went missing. And an apparition.
  - "You mean a g\u2026 ghost?"
  - Yes, a ghost of my grandfather. Some family members have seen him
  - So why did you call me?
  - "You are a detective, that\u2019s why. "
  - "But I am not good with ghosts. I\u2019m totally afraid of them. \t                                                                                    
    I\u2019ll just be going back home, now. "
  - "You are not. Don\u2019t forget why your parents gave you this name."
  - "I know, so I can always move forward and never look back. \t                                                             
    That\u2019s what I am doing. I will not look back because I don\u2019t want to
    see a ghost behind me! "
  - "I know you desperately need a case\u2026 and here is one. \tI will pay you good
    amount "
  - " Well\u2026 you\u2019ve got my attention. How much?"
  - "Hmmm\u2026 a ticket to local circus"
  - "What? I\u2019ve been there couple of times already anyway."
  - "I know, but I had one extr\u2026 I mean, ahhh\u2026 I\u2026 bought this just
    for you.  \t              Now, please concentrate on the case. "
  - " Hmmm\u2026 Where is the rest of your family? "
  - 'They all moved. Nobody wants to stay in the haunted house. '
  - Me too! But why are you here?
  - 'I stayed here because of the will. The will is missing.                                                           
    My grandfather used to keep it in his safe but now it is not there. '
  - ' You mean someone has stolen it'
  - 'No, I think my grandfather has hidden it somewhere else. '
  - And you want it back, right?
  - 'Of course. My uncle, Mr. Barnard has a will which mentions this house now belongs
    to him. But why would my grandfather give his property to Mr. Bernard, his nephew,
    instead of giving it to his legal heir who is my mom? '
  - "I want the original will back in my possession. I searched the whole house but
    I haven\u2019t been able to find it anywhere. Please help me March. You are my
    last hope. "
  - Alright, you can count on me.
  - 'I can use my camera on certain areas to get more information about them. Let
    me try dragging & dropping it on the fireplace. '
